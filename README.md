just stumbled out of the theater. wow, novocaine. popcorn crumbs all over the place, sticking like barnacles to my pants. so loud in there, people chewing n talking like they're in their kitchens.   totally unexpected, man, like eating a lemon when you thought it was an apple. 

> steve martin's face... that look he gives, it’s like a fish just got caught in a rare 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 of consciousness. his expressions got under my skin. why's he always the dentist? everything's so white and clean, like an operating room minus the calm. did i say one of the patients looked like a pufferfish blew up in there? maybe that's just my tired eyes. 

my back's aching something fierce, those theater seats are torture devices, like sitting on a boat in a storm. the scenes keep splashing over my brainwaves, can't piece them together right. helena bonham carter—she's like a damn siren, pulling everyone into some off-kilter whirlpool. she's the needle; he’s the numbness. perfect chaos. feeling my own mind numbing trying to make sense of it all, waves of dialogue crashing nonsensically. maybe need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, or 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it, get all the pieces to click.

can't get the buzz of the drill out of my head, like a wasp colony invading my eardrums. is novocaine ever this loud? of course everything 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬les when you touch it, like that cellophane wrapping you can't peel off without an earthquake. real life ain't this weird... or maybe it's weird-er. confusing plot like the tangled nets in the back of my pickup on Sunday morning.

>there's this scene, right? like, everybody’s guilty but trying to smile through the numbness, a daggone laugh-and-cry circus, you know. steve's eyes looked like two caught fish flipping around, can’t decipher if it’s joy or doom. reminds me when I accidentally caught a shoe once, the disappointment, hilarious but flat.

oh someone asked if they sould 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . i remember that. might have said yes. who knows, am so mixed up after all those shaky camera angles.

leaving now with an odd urge to floss, odd feeling like saltwater coating my mouth. can't shake the bizarre undercurrent, somehow comforting in its strangeness, like waking up too early from a surreal nap. gotta go untangle my thoughts now, like sorting out fishing lines at midnight.
